<div class="frameworklabel">Sustaining the evolution of Coq while giving a voice to stakeholders</div>
<div class="frameworkcontent">

<p>For many years, the development of Coq has been supported and
funded almost exclusively by French academic institutions, most
notably Inria. But today, there are intensive Coq users, and thus
major stakeholders, in universities and companies all over the
world.</p>

<p>The objective of the Consortium is to empower this community of
users, whose research and development critically rely on the Coq
system.  For these users, making sure that the system's maintenance is
well funded is essential.  They can do so by providing resources
either as donations, Consortium membership or support service
subscriptions.  Furthermore, Consortium members and support service
subscribers get a voice in the evolution of Coq, by determining where
some engineering resources are allocated.</p>

<p>To summarize, on the one hand, we wish to
establish <strong>transparent ways of contributing financially and
technically</strong> to the development of the system; on the other
hand we wish to make sure that the <strong>most pressing needs of
major stakeholders are addressed efficiently</strong> by providing a
fantastic working environment to competent Coq developers.</p>

<p>The Coq Consortium is hosted by Inria (the French national institute for
research in digital science and technology), the premier actor behind
the development of Coq.</p>

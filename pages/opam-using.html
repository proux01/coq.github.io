<h2>What is opam?</h2>

<p>Opam is the package manager for the OCaml programming language, the language
in which Coq is implemented.
Opam 2.1 is the recommended version, and is assumed below.
Instructions on
<a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html">how to install opam</a>
itself are available on the opam website.
The following command displays the version of opam you have installed:</p>

<pre><code># Make sure opam version is 2.1.0 or above.
opam --version
</code></pre>

<p>Follow the instructions below to install the last stable version of
Coq and additional packages. The instructions target an opam
newcomer.</p>

<p>Note that these instructions will also work for Opam 2.0 but this
may require you to manually install any external dependencies. In this
case you will have to use <code>opam-depext</code> to see which
external dependencies are missing.</p>

<p>For some operating systems, <code>opam</code>
and <code>opam-depext</code> might still be unable to detect external
dependencies, which will mean you have to check and install them
yourself. To see more detailed information on external dependencies
please consult
the <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md
documentation in the Github repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="platform">The Coq platform scripts</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/coq/platform">Coq platform</a>
provides interactive scripts that allow installing Coq and a standard
set of packages through opam without having to learn anything about
opam.</p>

<p>If a standard setup works for you, then we recommend that you use
these <a href="https://github.com/coq/platform">scripts</a>.  If you
do, you can skip directly to <a href="#coq-packages">Using opam to
install Coq packages</a> to learn how to add additional packages to
the initial package set provided by the platform.</p>

<p>Note that the platform scripts are compatible with existing opam
installations. They will create a
fresh <a href="#switch">switch.</a></p>

<p>If you prefer to do a fully manual installation, you can proceed to
the next section.</p>

<h2>Initializing opam</h2>

<p>Once opam is installed, it must be initialized before first
usage:</p>

<pre><code>opam init
eval $(opam env)
</code></pre>

<p><code>opam init</code> will prompt you to allow opam to set up
initialization scripts, which is generally fine to accept. Otherwise,
every time a new shell is opened you have to type in the
<code>eval $(opam env)</code> command above to update environment variables.</p>

<p>By default, opam will use the global installation of OCaml. You can
initialize opam with an explicit compiler version, for example
<#OCAMLV>, with the option
<code>--compiler=ocaml-base-compiler.<#OCAMLV></code>.
See also the section "Managing different versions of OCaml and Coq" below,
about switches and roots.
</p>

<h2>Installing Coq</h2>

<p>To install Coq, simply run the following command. Note that
installing Coq using opam will build it from sources, which will take
several minutes to complete:</p>

<pre><code># Pin the coq package to version <#CURRENTVERSION> and install it.
opam pin add coq <#CURRENTVERSION>
</code></pre>

<p>Pinning prevents opam from upgrading Coq automatically, which may
cause inadvertent breakage in your Coq projects. You can upgrade Coq
explicitly to
<code>$NEW_VERSION</code> with essentially the same command:</p>

<pre><code>opam pin add coq $NEW_VERSION
</code></pre>

<p>To ensure that installation was successful, check that <code>coqc
-v</code> prints the expected version of Coq.</p>

<h3>Installing CoqIDE</h3>

<p>You may also want to install CoqIDE. Note that this requires GTK+
development files (<code>gtksourceview3</code>) to be available on the
system. Opam (>=2.1) will ensure that these packages are installed (on
most operating systems). To install CoqIDE, simply run:</p>

<pre><code>opam install coqide
</code></pre>

<p>There exist many <a href="/user-interfaces.html">alternative user
interfaces / editor extensions</a> for Coq.  See their respective
websites for instructions on how to install them.</p>

<h2 id="coq-packages">Using opam to install Coq packages</h2>

<p>Coq packages live in a repository separate from the standard OCaml
opam repository. The following command adds that repository to the
current opam <a href="#switch">switch</a> (you can skip this step if
you used the <a href="#platform">platform scripts</a>):</p>

<pre><code>opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
</code></pre>

<p>The following command lists the names of all Coq packages along
with short descriptions:</p>

<pre><code>opam search coq
</code></pre>

<p>You can access a more detailed description of a package,
say <code>coq-sudoku</code>, using the command:</p>

<pre><code>opam show coq-sudoku
</code></pre>

<p>You can then install the package using the command:</p>

<pre><code>opam install coq-sudoku
</code></pre>

<h2>Managing different versions of OCaml and Coq</h2>

<p>By default, opam will use the global OCaml installation. Opam can
handle different versions of OCaml and other packages (including Coq)
via
<em>switches</em> or <em>roots</em>.</p>

<h3 id="switch">Switches</h3>

<p>Switches provide separate environments, with their own versions of
OCaml and installed packages. More information about opam
switches <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html#opam-switch">can
be found here</a>.</p>

<p>The following command creates a switch named <code>with-coq</code>
with OCaml <#OCAMLV>:</p>

<pre><code># Run one of the following depending on your version of opam
opam switch create with-coq <#OCAMLV>
</code></pre>

<p>Change to an existing switch named <code>other-switch</code> with
this command:</p>

<pre><code>opam switch other-switch
eval $(opam env)
</code></pre>

<h3>Roots</h3>

<p>Opam stores all its configuration (including switches) in a
directory called <em>root</em> (by default, <code>~/.opam</code>). The
path to the root can be set using the <code>$OPAMROOT</code>
environment variable, providing an alternative way of creating fresh
opam environments.
</p>

<p>The main benefit of roots is that they can be used simultaneously,
but they require some external bookkeeping. In comparison. switches
are entirely managed by opam, and they can share the global
configuration of a single root.
</p>

<pre><code># Set a new root location export
OPAMROOT=~/.opam-coq.<#CURRENTVERSION>

# Initialize the root with an explicit OCaml version.
opam init -n --compiler=ocaml-base-compiler.<#OCAMLV>

# Install Coq in this new root (same commands as above)
opam pin add coq <#CURRENTVERSION>
</code></pre>

<p>Every time a new shell is opened, or you want to use a different
root, type in the following lines:
</p>

<pre><code>export OPAMROOT=~/.opam-coq.<#CURRENTVERSION>
eval $(opam env)
</code></pre>
